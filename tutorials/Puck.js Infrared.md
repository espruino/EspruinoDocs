Infrared Record and Playback with Puck.js

This video shows you how to control Infrared devices using Puck.js.

[[http://youtu.be/et58ozE-Cu8]]

You'll need a [Puck.js](/Puck.js) and an [Infrared Receiver](/IRReceiver)

**Note:** If you don't have an IR receiver you may be able to find the
'pronto hex' code for your device online. You can then [decode it with this library](/pronto).

Recording
---------

The code used in the video is:

```
digitalWrite(D2,0);
pinMode(D1,"input_pullup");
var d = [];
setWatch(function(e) {
  d.push(1000*(e.time-e.lastTime));
}, D1, {edge:"both",repeat:true});
```

You can use the following to output the contents of the `d` array
rounded to 1 decimal place (which is much more readable):

```
console.log(d.map(a=>a.toFixed(1)).toString())
```

In fact adding the following code will automatically print the received
Infrared code as soon as you have sent it:

```
var lastLen = 0;
setInterval(function() {
  if (d.length && d.length==lastLen) {
    d.shift(); // remove first element
    console.log(d.map(a=>a.toFixed(1)).toString());
    d=[];
  }
  lastLen = d.length;
},200);
```

For the particular light bulb used in the video, the codes are as follows:

```

Playback
--------

All you need to do to play back is to pass an array into `Puck.IR`. For example if you have
a lightbulb like the one I used, simply typing `Puck.IR(commands.on)` will turn it on.

You can also use Web Bluetooth to send data from a webpage to *any Puck* - it doesn't have
to be pre-programmed as the Web Page can send the code and data at once.

Buying
------

You can buy the IR remote control lights like the ones I used from
[eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=rgb+led+light+ir+remote+control&_sacat=0).
They are also available in strip form.

**Note:** while some of these lights look identical, they often use a different
set of control codes. About the only way to be sure is to record your own codes.
