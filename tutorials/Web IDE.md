**Note:** The Web IDE has recently been updated. We'll be adding some more information about it here shortly...

### Installing the development version

We only update the Web IDE when we're sure that everything is working. If you want the 'Cutting Edge' version then you can [get it directly from GitHub](www.github.com/espruino/EspruinoWebIDE). There instructions on how to get started on the main page.
