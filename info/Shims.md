Espruino Pico 'Shims'
===================

* KEYWORDS: Pico,Shim,Adaptor,Shield

'Shims' for the Espruino Pico are small adaptor boards that you can solder to the Espruino Pico to make it easier to attach devices. For example:

ESP8266 WiFi

WIZnet W550io Ethernet

Where can I get one?
------------------

We're now selling a selection of shims [on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/gfwilliams/). However all the shims we've designed are Open Source.

You can [view and download them here](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoBoard/tree/master/Pico/Adaptors) and can then send the designs (`.brd` files) to someone like [OSHPark](https://www.oshpark.com/) who will manufacture them to order for a very reasonable price.
