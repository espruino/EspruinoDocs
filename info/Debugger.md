Espruino Debugger
===============

* KEYWORDS: Debug,Debugger,Finding Problems

As of Espruino 1v81, there is now a built-in text mode debugger available, which allows you to step through your code line by line. The commands used are almost identical to those in GDB.

**Note:** If you have a board with very little flash memory (128kB or less) the debugger may not be included in your build. However it *is* available for all official Espruino boards.

Entering the debugger
-------------------

If your program has actually hung (isn't returning to the prompt) then you can press `Ctrl-C` in order to enter debug mode. Otherwise, to force a breakpoint you need to add the text `debugger` where you want a breakpoint to occur:

```
function bar(one) {
  return one+" ";
}

function foo(one, two) {
  return one+two;
}

function hello() {
  var a = "Hello";
  var b = "World";
  console.log(1);
  debugger;
  console.log(2);
  foo(bar(a),b);
  console.log(3);
}
```

When you then run `hello()`, you'll enter debug mode at the `debugger` keyword. The terminal will now show `debug>` and you're ready to enter debugging commands.

When in debug mode type `help` for a list of what's available.

**Note:** if you want to debug a single function without modifying it, you can simply type `debugger;myfunction()` in Espruino's console.

Exiting the debugger
------------------

To exit back to the normal prompt, press `Ctrl-C` again, or type `q` or `quit`.

If you want to let your program continue running, type `c` or `continue`.


Using the debugger
----------------

When in debug mode, you'll see the current statement pointed to with an arrow. For instance use the code snippet above, and you'll see:

```
>hello()
1
  debugger;
  ^
debug> 
```

You'll notice that `console.log(1);` was already executed, because that's above the `debugger` keyword.

Now, you can do some debugging. Type `info locals` (or `i l` for short) - this will show you the values of any local variables:

```
debug>info locals
Locals:
--------------------------------
 a                    : "Hello"
 b                    : "World"
```

But perhaps you want to find the value of just one variable? No problem - you can type `print a` (or `p a`) to print the value of a:

```
debug>print a
="Hello"
```

What you type on the end of `print` can actually be an expression, so you can change the value of a variable:

```
debug>print a="Goodbye"
="Goodbye"
debug>info locals
Locals:
--------------------------------
 a                    : "Goodbye"
 b                    : "World"
```

And now, you can step through the code. Type `next` (or `n`) to go to the next statement, or `step` (or `s`) to step into a function call.

Using `next`:

```
debug>n
  console.log(2);
  ^
debug>n
2
  foo(bar(a),b);
  ^
debug>n
  console.log(3);
  ^
debug>n
3
Value returned is =undefined
=undefined
> 
```

Or using `step`, you step inside the functions `bar` and `foo`:

```
debug>s
  console.log(2);
  ^
debug>s
2
  foo(bar(a),b);
  ^
debug>s
Stepping into bar
  return one+" ";
  ^
debug>s
Value returned is ="Goodbye "
Stepping into foo
  return one+two;
  ^
debug>
```

You can also type `finish` (or `f`) to run to the end of the function `foo`, and the return value will be displayed.

```
debug>finish
Value returned is ="GoodbyeWorld"
}
^
```

Finally, if you type `continue` or `c` then the debugger will exit and the program will resume as normal:

```
debug>c
3
=undefined
>
```

Conditional Breakpoints
---------------------

If you want to break into the debugger only when something happens, you can call `debugger` from inside an `if` statement:

```
for (var i=0;i<10;i++) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i==5) debugger;
}
```

This will enter the debugger only when `i` is 5.
