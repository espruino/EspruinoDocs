Inline Assembler
=============

* KEYWORDS: Assembler,Asm,ARM,Thumb,Thumb2,Thumb-2,C code,inline C,Built-In

The Web IDE allows you to write inline assembler in the right-hand pane.

```
var adder = E.asm("int(int)",
"movs    r1, #3",
"adds    r0, r0, r1", // add two 32 bit values
"bx  lr"); // return
```

Which can then be used like a normal function:

```
>adder(2)
=5
>[1,2,3,4,5].map(adder)
=[4,5,6,7,8]
```

This is handled as follows:

* When you click `Send to Espruino` the Web IDE pulls out the `E.asm` call
* It runs the strings you supplied through [its assembler](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoWebIDE/blob/master/js/plugins/assembler.js) (which doesn't support all the ARM's opCodes yet)
* It then creates code to load the assembler into Espruino as a String
* It uses [`E.nativeCall`](http://www.espruino.com/Reference#l_E_nativeCall) to create a JavaScript function using the code that was generated.

**Note:**

* The assembler is only partially implemented so will only parse some opcodes at the moment. If you find something missing [please let us know!](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoTools/issues)
* If this is a bit hardcore for you, there's now the option of [Compiled JavaScript](/Compilation)

For an ARM Thumb reference, [see this link](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ece222/ARM/ARM7-TDMI-manual-pt3.pdf)

Argument Specifiers / Call Signature
--------------------------------

The first argument of `E.asm` (and `E.nativeCall`) is the signature of the call, of the type:

```Text
returnType (argType1,argType2,...)
```

Allowed types are `void`, `bool`, `int`, `double`, `Pin` (a pin number), `JsVar` (a pointer to a JsVar structure).

*Note:* due to restrictions inside Espruino, you cannot have more than 5 arguments to the function.


Calling Convention (what you can use!)
---------------------------------

For a better explanation of this, [see Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention#ARM)

The registers r0, r1, r2 and r3 contain the first 4 32 bit arguments, and r0 is used to return the 32 bit result. Other arguments are passed on the stack (which we're not covering here).

Registers r0-r3 are free to use - however any other registers have to be restored to their previous values before the function returns to the caller. This is usually done using `push {r4,r5,r6,...}` and `pop {r4,r5,r6,...}`.


Accessing Data
------------

By itself, the assembler isn't too useful. What you need is to be able to access your data. Luckily Espruino makes it pretty easy. Above, we used `Array.map` to call assembler for every element in an array - you can use this on `ArrayBuffer`s like `Uint8Array` too. This is not part of the EcmaScript 5 spec (but is in EcmaScript 6).

```
>var a = new Uint8Array([1,2,3,4,5]);
a.map(adder)
=[4,5,6,7,8]
```

However this will still return an ArrayBuffer (which will use up more RAM). If you don't want to return anything (maybe you're writing it out to GPIO (see below) ), use `forEach`:

```
>a.forEach(adder);
=undefined
```

Or you can use `Array.reduce` to pass an argument between calls to the assembler, for instance to sum all the items in the array:

```
// create and fill up array buffer
var a = new Int16Array(100);
for (var i in a) a[i]=i;

// effectively this is 'function (a,b) { return a+b; }'
var adder = E.asm("int(int,int)", 
  "adds    r0, r0, r1",
  "bx  lr");

// Call our assembler on every item and return the result
var sum = a.reduce(adder);

// prints 4950 
console.log(sum); 
```

Constants
--------

In ARM Thumb, you can't store full 32 bit literal values in assembler, so loading big constants is a bit harder than you'd expect. Instead of directly specifying the constant, you must define an area of memory that will contain it, and then you must reference that area (relative to the current instruction). This is even more painful because the program counter is 4 bytes ahead of current execution:

```
var getConst = E.asm("int()",
"ldr	r0, [pc, #0]", // 2*2 - 4 = 0
"bx lr",
".word	0x1234BEEF"
);

console.log(getConst().toString(16));
```

In reality, you'll want to use labels and let the assembler sort this out for you:

```
var getConst = E.asm("int()",
"  ldr	r0, my_data",
"  bx lr",
"my_data:",
"  .word	0x1234BEEF"
);

console.log(getConst().toString(16));
```

Even this can cause some problems. You can only access an address that is a multiple of 4 bytes *ahead of the current instruction*. If you get an error when assembling such as `Invalid number 'mylabel' - must be between 0 and 1020 and a multiple of 4` then you'll need to pad out the constants with a `nop`:

```
var getConst = E.asm("int()",
"  ldr	r1, my_data",
"  mov  r0,r1", // extra instruction makes non-2 aligned
"  bx lr",
"  nop", // must pad
"my_data:",
"  .word	0x1234BEEF"
);

console.log(getConst().toString(16));
```

**Note:** If you just need a small constant then you may be ok. You can use `mov` to load a value between 0 and 255:

```
var getConst = E.asm("int()",
"mov	r0, #254",
"bx lr",
);
```

Or you can use `movw` to load a 16 bit values (between 0 and 65535) but *movw is a double-length instruction that takes 4 bytes in total*.

```
var getConst = E.asm("int()",
"movw	r0, #65535",
"bx lr",
);
```

Storing Data
-----------

While ARM Thumb has a `LDR` instruction that will load from a label, there is no such thing for a store. Instead, you need to use the `ADR` pseudo-instruction to store the address in a register which you can then use in the store instruction.

For example the following section of code will return a value that increments after each call:

```
var inc = E.asm("int()",
"adr    r1, data", // Get address of 'data'
"ldr    r0, [r1]", // Load the value of data into R0
"add    r0, #1",   // Add one to it
"str    r0, [r1]", // Save the value of R0 into 'data'
"bx lr",           // Return (R0 is the value)
"nop",
"data:",           // ... padding
".word    0x0"     // the word that we'll increment
);
```


Accessing IO
-----------

You can write directly to the hardware in order to perform IO very quickly. However how you do this depends on the CPU on your board...

### STM32F1 (original Espruino Board)

Useful docs are:

* STM32F103 reference (see [[EspruinoBoard]])
* [STM32F1 header file](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/targetlibs/stm32f1/lib/stm32f10x.h) - see `GPIO_BASE` and `GPIO_TypeDef`.

GPIOA's Output data register is `0x4001080C` (which sets ALL pins on that port). To set individual pins you can write to BSRR = `0x40010810` and to clear them you can write to BRR = `0x40010814`

So you could write the following code to give the 3 LEDs (on A13,A14 and A15) a quick pulse.

```
digitalWrite([LED1,LED2,LED3],0); // set up the output state (easier done in JS!)

var pulse = E.asm("void()",
" ldr	r2, gpioa_addr", // Get the gpio address
" movw	r3, #57344", // the bit mask for A13,A14,A15 - 0b1110000000000000 = 57344
" str	r3, [r2, #0]", // set *0x40010810 = 57344 (set pins A13-A15)
" str	r3, [r2, #4]", // set *0x40010814 = 57344 (clear pins A13-A15)
" bx	lr", // return
"gpioa_addr:"
" .word	0x40010810" 
// Our data
);

pulse();
```

### STM32F4 (Espruino Pico)

Useful docs are:

* STM32F401 reference (see [[Pico]])
* [STM32F401 header file](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/targetlibs/stm32f4/lib/stm32f401xe.h) - see `GPIO_BASE` and `GPIO_TypeDef`.

GPIOB's Output data register is `0x40020414` (GPIOA is `0x40020014`). Writing to that address sets ALL pins on that port. To set individual pins you can write to the lower 16 bits of BSRR = `0x40020418` and to clear them you can write to the upper 16 bits.

So you could write the following code to give LED1 a quick pulse (it's on pin B2).

```
digitalWrite(LED1,0); // set up the output state (easier done in JS!)

var pulse = E.asm("void()",
 "ldr  r2,gpiob_addr", 
 "movw  r0,#4", // 1<<2 = pin 2 on the port
 "lsl r1,r0,#16", // shift it left by 16 for the reset register
 "str  r0,[r2]", // Turn on
 "str  r1,[r2]", // Turn off
 "bx  lr",
 "nop",
 "gpiob_addr:",
 ".word  0x40020418"
 );
pulse();
```


Loops
-----

You can do loops as follows. This example adds together all the numbers below and including the current one:

```
var a = E.asm("int(int,int)", 
  "loopStart:"
  " adds   r0, r0, r1",
  " sub    r1, r1, #1",
  " cmp    r1, #0",
  " bgt    loopStart",
  " bx  lr");

for (var i=1;i<10;i++)
  console.log(i, a(0,i));

// 1 1
// 2 3
// 3 6
// 4 10
// 5 15
// 6 21
// 7 28
// 8 36
// 9 45
```

### Note:

* This example will crash Espruino for any number less than or equal to zero
* Labels take some of the pain out of this. `bgt loopStart` is actually equivalent to `bgt #-10`: The program counter is always 4 bytes ahead of the current instruction, and instructions are (usually!) 2 bytes long. That means that to get back to the exact same instruction you must use `-4` and you must subtract another 2 for each instruction you want to jump over (hence `-10`).


setWatch
--------

As of Espruino 1v72, `setWatch` can now call native code from within the interrupt - which is much faster than if the code was executed from the event loop.

For instance the following code measures the number of state changes every second on BTN:

```
// inc function from above
var inc = E.asm("void()",
"adr    r1, data",
"ldr    r0, [r1]",
"add    r0, #1",
"str    r0, [r1]",
"bx lr",
"nop",
"data:",
".word    0x0"
);
var dataPtr = ASM_BASE-4; // the address of 'data'

// Now call inc when the button is pressed - in an IRQ
setWatch(inc, BTN, { irq:true });

// every second...
setInterval(function() { 
  console.log(peek32(dataPtr)); // print the value of the counter
  poke32(dataPtr,0); // reset the counter
}, 1000);
```

In order to be properly useful you'll probably want to access the current time:

* Low precision 16 bit (32/40 kHz) on Espruino (F103): RTC DIVL (0x40002814)
* Low precision 16 bit (32 kHz) on Espruino Pico (F401): RTC_SSR (0x40002828)
* Higher precision 32 bit (72/80 Mhz) use SYSTICK (0xE000E018), which stops when the device sleeps.


Compiling C Code
--------------

While you can't directly inline C code (yet!), once you have [installed a toolchain that will compile Espruino](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/README.md#building), you can compile C code with:

```Bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc -mlittle-endian -mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m3  -mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd  -mthumb-interwork -mfloat-abi=soft -nostdinc -nostdlib -c test.c -o test.o
# you can also add -O3 to the command-line to optimise the code
```

And you can dump the contents of the object file with:

```Bash
arm-none-eabi-objdump -S test.o
```

You might get something like:

```
00000010 <pulse>:
  10:	4a02      	ldr	r2, [pc, #8]	; (1c <pulse+0xc>)
  12:	f44f 4360 	mov.w	r3, #57344	; 0xe000
  16:	6013      	str	r3, [r2, #0]
  18:	6053      	str	r3, [r2, #4]
  1a:	4770      	bx	lr
  1c:	40010810 	.word	0x40010810
```

Which you can then turn into:

```
var ASM_BASE=process.memory().stackEndAddress;
var ASM_BASE1=ASM_BASE+1/*thumb*/;
[0x4a02,0xf44f,0x4360,0x6013,0x6053,0x4770,0x0810,0x4001].forEach(function(v) { poke16((ASM_BASE+=2)-2,v); }); 
var pulse = E.nativeCall(ASM_BASE1, "void()")
```

**Note:** The best method is now to convert the raw opcodes to a base64 encoded string, and to then use the following:

```
var myFn = E.nativeCall(1, "void ()", atob("w4D...my...base64...encoded...data...AAAg"))
```

This will save the program code into Espruino's variable storage, so `save()` will store it along with everything else. Note that we're passing `1` as the offset, because it is Thumb assembly.
