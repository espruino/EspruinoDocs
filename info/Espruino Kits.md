### Starter Kit tutorials

**Note:** In the reference card that comes with your starter kit, the [IR Receiver](/IRReceiver) is incorrectly referred to as a transmitter.

<a name="pico_tutorials"></a>These are suitable for the Starter Kit, Ultimate Toy Kit, as well as the Geek Kit (if you own breadboard and Jumper Wires).

* APPEND_USES: PicoStarterKit

There are plenty of other [[Tutorials]] that can be used with the Pico, but those above deal with exactly the contents of the Starter Kit.
