This example shows you how to use an [[ILI9341]] display
to output a series of images loaded from SD card (there's an SD card connector on the back of the display).

Wiring
------

* Put an Espruino [[Pico]] into breadboard, with the USB connector facing left
* Place the [[ILI9341]] into the breadboard as show in the image - directly above the Pico
* Connect the top-left pin of the Pico (VCC on the LCD) to 3.3v on the Pico
* Connect the top-2nd-left pin of the Pico (GND on the LCD) to GND on the Pico
* Now connect the 4 end pins on the LCD (for the SD card) as follows:

| LCD | Pico |
|-----|------|
| SD_SCK | B3 |
| SD_MISO | B4 |
| SD_MOSI | B5 |
| SD_CS | B6 |

Images
------

Before we can get started, we need to cheat a bit. Espruino can't decode JPEG files on-chip - the display is 320x240 pixels at 16bpp - that's 153600 bytes - which is more RAM than Espruino has in total!

Instead, we're going to store the pictures in a format that Espruino can load directly onto the LCD.

To do that, we need to resize the pictures by 320x240, rotate them (the display is actually 240x320), and convert them to a raw 16bpp RGB565 file formatr.

This is something that you can do with the [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) command-line tools. You just need the command:

```
convert -size 320x240 -rotate 90 -depth 8 inputfile.jpg \
            -channel R +level 0,31 -evaluate multiply 2048 +channel \
            -channel G +level 0,63 -evaluate multiply 32 +channel \
            -channel B +level 0,31 -evaluate multiply 1 +channel \
            -channel RGBA -separate +channel  \
            -channel R -evaluate-sequence add  +channel \
            -depth 16   R:outputfile.raw
```

There's one final step - the display expects 16 bits per pixel, but those bits are sent as two 8 bit bytes. Unfortunately when ImageMagick writes the file, it writes those two bytes in the wrong order so you need to swap them.

On Linux, this is easy:

```
dd if=outputfile.raw of=fixedoutputfile.raw conv=swab
```

But on Windows/Mac you may have to find another method.

Once you've got the files sorted, copy them into the root of an SD empty card and put in in the LCD.

Software
--------

Just put the code below into the right-hand side of the Web IDE and click upload. It won't work immediately - you'll have to type `save()` on the left-hand side to load it and start it working.
