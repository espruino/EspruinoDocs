MCP9808 precision I2C temperature sensor
========================================

* KEYWORDS: Module,I2C,MCP9808,temperature,sensor

This is a module that makes it easy to connect to a MCP9808 Precision [[I2C]] Temperature sensor.

The MCP9808 is a precision [[I2C]] temperature sensor from Microchip between -20째C and +100째C with +- 0.25째C / +- 0.5째C (typical/maximum) accuracy. This module makes it easy to connect this sensor with an espruino board.

Use the [MCP9808](/modules/MCP9808.js) module for it.

Wiring Up
---------

| Pin   | Espruino |
|-------|----------|
| GND   | GND      |
| VCC   | 3.3v     |
| SDA   | B7       |
| SCL   | B6       |
| ALERT | Open-Drain-Output |
| A2    | GND or 3.3v |
| A1    | GND or 3.3v |
| A0    | GND or 3.3v |

Software
--------

How to use the module:

```
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7, bitrate: 60000});
var mcp = require("MCP9808").connect(I2C1, 0b000); // 0b000 means A2 = A2 = A1 = GND 
var temperature = mcp.getTemperature();
console.log("Temperature: " + temperature + " C");
```

The sensor can handle bitrates up to 400000 but I had stability problems with this.
