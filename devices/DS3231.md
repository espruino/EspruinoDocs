**Note:** Espruino contains its own RTC - see [[Clocks]]. However if you need a battery backed-up RTC with full calendar functionality then this may be a better solution.


<p>The module <a href="/modules/DS3231.js">DS3231</a> (<a href="/Modules">About Modules</a>) for interfacing with this sensor
will only connect via the <a href="/I2C">I2C</a> interface.</p>


The DS3231 RTC chip is used in a few off the shelf modules.  This document assumes that you are using the precision rtc module from Jeelabs.

| Espruino | JeeLabs Precision RTC Module |
|----------|------------------------------|
| 3V3 | VCC |
| GND | GND |
| B6 (SCL) | DIO |
| B7 (SDA) | AIO |

**Note:** Connect I2C pull up resistors on B6 and B7 to 3V3.

The following reads from the RTC module and prints the date and time in a string to the console every second.

```Javascript
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7});
var rtc = require("DS3231").connect(I2C1, { DST : true });
setInterval(function() {
  console.log(rtc.readDateTime());
}, 1000);
```


Initialising
------------

Initialise the module by calling `require("DS3231").connect`, passing in an
`I2C` interface and an optional `option` object:

```
var rtc = require("DS3231").connect(I2C1, {
  DST : true  // make UK daylight saving changes automatically (default=true)
});
```


Daylight saving
---------------

The day of the week is required so that the clocks move forwards and backwards
at the correct times for daylight saving in the UK.

You need to specify this as follows:

```Javascript
// one of "Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"
rtc.setDow("Monday")
```

Please note that you need to call the readDateTime function at least every
second for daylight saving to work.


Setting Date/Time
-----------------

To set the date:

```Javascript
rtc.setDate(date,month,year);
```

To set the time:

```Javascript
rtc.setTime(hours,minutes);
```
