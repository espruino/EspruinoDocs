The CAP1188 is an 8-channel capacitive touch sensor and is available in a handy [breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1602). This module enables I2C communication with the chip to easily get information about which pins are being touched. It's based on [Adafruit CAP1188 Arduino libary](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CAP1188_Library). Use the [CAP1188](/modules/CAP1188.js) ([About Modules](/Modules)) module for it.

You can wire this up as follows:

| Device Pin | Espruino |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 1 (GND)    | GND      |
| 2 (VIN)    | 3.3      |
| 3 (SDA)    | B7       |
| 4 (SCK)    | B6       |

Basic usage:

```
I2C1.setup({scl:B6,sda:B7});
var cap = require("CAP1188").connect(I2C1);
cap.readTouches();
// Returns an array of 8 items for pins C1 - C8
//  true indicates a touch, false is no touch
```

Optionally, you can connect the reset pin on the board (marked RST), to a pin on the Espruino. Call the `reset()` method to reinitialize the sensor. An optional callback can be supplied that's called when the board has been reset.

```
var cap = require("CAP1188").connect(I2C1, { resetPin: B15 });
cap.reset(function () {
  // the board has been reset
});
```
