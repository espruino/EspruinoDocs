This module interfaces with OneWire EEPROMs like the DS24B33.  

Usage: 

Setup onewire, then call:

var eeprom=require("DS2xxx").connect(onewire, pagesize, capacity, nopartial, device)

onewire is the OneWire bus object. 

pagesize is the page size for page writes, in bytes. 

capacity is the eeprom capacity, in kbits. 

nopartial is true for devices that cannot start a write except on a page boundary, otherwise undefined or false. 

device is the code identifying the device, or it's number in the search. Optional - if undefined, the first device will be assumed. 

eeprom.read(address,bytes,asStr)
Read the specified number of bytes. If asStr is true, it will return the value as a string. 

eeprom.write(address,data)
Write the specified data starting at the specified address. Writes that cross page boundaries are handled transparently.
