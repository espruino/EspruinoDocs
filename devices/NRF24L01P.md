The Nordic [NRF24L01+](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/2.4GHz-RF/nRF24L01P) transceiver is very popular and works well with Espruino. It is sold in very inexpensive wireless modules that interface via SPI. They can easily be obtained via [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=NRF24L01%2B) and many other places for prices as low as $2.

A driver for it is available in the [[NRF24L01P.js]] module.

Connect as follows:

| NRF24L01+ | Name |  Espruino  | Type |
|-----------|------|------------| ---- |
| 1 | GND       | GND        | GND |
| 2 | 3.3V      | 3.3        | 3.3v |
| 3 | CE        | B1         | GPIO Out |
| 4 | CSN       | B0         | GPIO Out |
| 5 | SCK       | A5         | SPI SCK |
| 6 | MOSI      | A7         | SPI MOSI |
| 7 | MISO      | A6         | SPI MISO |
| 8 | IRQ       | unused     | GPIO In |

We'd also suggest that you add a 10nF - 100nF decoupling capacitor between GND and 3.3v. Some modules can be unrelible without this.

**Note:** You don't have to use the pins we've given, but these pins are all on the middle part of the board, leaving the edges free for IO.

You can either connect the module with wires and mount it separately, or you can solder it into the prototype area, and run wires as follows on the back of the board. We'd recommend using thin, solid core wire for this.

The finished wiring might look like this:

Notes
-----

* The NRF24L01+ is a packet radio. It can transmit and receive small packets (up to 32 bytes) of data
* Devices have a transmit and a receive address
* Devices can only transmit **or** receive. They can't do both at the same time
* Transmits are acknowledged - a module knows if the data it sent was received
* The NRF24 module can be unreliable at the higher 

The Espruino module allows you to send and receive strings. It does this by sending enough packets to contain the string plus a terminating zero. It will retry, but it is possible for parts of the string to get missed out.

Simple Usage
-----------

We've made simple handlers that allow you to send commands, receive data, and even reprogram a device...

Just do the following for a Slave:

```
SPI1.setup({sck:A5, miso:A6, mosi:A7});
var nrf = require("NRF24L01P").connect( SPI1, B0, B1 );
function onInit() {
  nrf.init([0,0,0,0,1], [0,0,0,0,2]);
}
onInit();
setInterval(function() {
  nrf.slaveHandler();
}, 50);
```

And the following for a Master:

```
SPI1.setup({sck:A5, miso:A6, mosi:A7});
var nrf = require("NRF24L01P").connect( SPI1, B0, B1 );
function onInit() {
  nrf.init([0,0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,0,1]);
}
onInit();
setInterval(function() {
  nrf.masterHandler();
}, 50);
```

Note the two addresses that are given to init - one is the transmit address, one is a receive address. We also use the ```onInit``` function, which is called automatically by Espruino when it starts up.

On a Master all you have to do is use nrf.sendCommand to send a command to the Slave Espruino, and in a few milliseconds the result will appear:

```JavaScript
nrf.sendCommand("1+2", function(r) { print("=="+r); });
=3

nrf.sendCommand("analogRead(A0)", function(r) { print("=="+r); });
=0.356694

nrf.sendCommand("LED2.set()", function(r) { print("=="+r); });
=undefined
```

You can even reprogram the Espruino wirelessly!

```
nrf.sendCommand("function on() { LED3.set(); }");
nrf.sendCommand("on();");
```

To communicate with another Espruino, all you need to do to is to call ```nrf.setTXAddr([1,2,3,4,5])``` on the master, giving the address that you have to the Slave Espruino's nrf.init function.

Advanced Usage
------------

The usage of ```slaveHandler``` and ```masterHandler``` is not required - if you want, you can call methods such as ```send``` and ```getDataPipe()``` directly. For instance you could make a simple wireless sensor:

```
SPI1.setup({sck:A5, miso:A6, mosi:A7});
var nrf = require("NRF24L01P").connect( SPI1, B0, B1 );
function onInit() {
  nrf.init([0,0,0,0,1], [0,0,0,0,2]);
}
onInit();
setInterval(function() {
  var value = analogRead(A0); // read a value in
  nrf.sendString(""+value);
}, 5000);
```

And then a receiver:

```
SPI1.setup({sck:A5, miso:A6, mosi:A7});
var nrf = require("NRF24L01P").connect( SPI1, B0, B1 );
function onInit() {
  nrf.init([0,0,0,0,2], [0,0,0,0,1]);
}
onInit();

dataLine = "";
setInterval(function() {
  while (nrf.nrf.getDataPipe() !== undefined) {
    var data = nrf.getData();
    for (var i in data) {
      var ch = data[i];
      if (ch===0 && dataLine!=="") {
        console.log(dataLine);
        // we could even save it onto an SD card using require('fs').appendFile("log.txt", dataLine+"\n");
        dataLine = "";
      } else if (ch!==0) {
        dataLine += String.fromCharCode(ch);
      }
    }
  }
}, 50);
```

More Advanced Usage
-----------------

You can send individual packets using ```NRF.send(data)```, where data is an array of numbers of length ```NRF.PAYLOAD```. To receive you can use the same ```NRF.getData()``` function. For more information consult the module ([[NRF24L01P.js]]).
