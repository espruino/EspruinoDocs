![433Mhz modules](433Mhz/module.jpg)

The 433.92Mhz modules are generally pretty basic. Each module is either an AM transmitter or an AM receiver, and has a single digital input or output.

There is no real filtering/encoding/decoding performed by the module. If there is a signal the receiver outputs a logic 1, and if there isn't it outputs a logic 0. This means that everything has to be handled by Espruino.

The modules appear to have quite a wide input voltage range (3.3v - 12v) however check your part's description first! We've found that at lower voltages (for instance 3.3v) the receiver works but at limited sensitivity (which is sometimes good if you want to isolate the signal from a nearby transmitter).

### Receiver

The Receiver often has 4 wires, although the middle two (signal) are connected together - leaving just GND, VCC and Signal (Data Out) to connect up.

**Note:** As the 433.92Mhz band is used by all kinds of devices, you may find that there is a huge amount of data on the Data Out line, and that it is hard to isolate weaker signals.

### Transmitter

The Transmitter usually has just 3 wires, GND, VCC and Signal (Data In).
