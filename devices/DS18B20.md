DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

![DS18B20 Cable](cable.jpg)

One of the most common 1-Wire devices is the DS18B20 thermometer. Use the [[DS18B20.js]] module for it.

**Note:** The DS18B20 comes in both a cable, an SMD, and a transistor-style package. We're only covering the cable here, but for others see the [Datasheet](/datasheets/DS18B20.pdf).

Connect as in the table below, with a 4.7k resistor between data and the 3.3v line. 

There seem to be three types of cabled sensor (listed below - please tell us if you find more!). **Note:** there are *two types of Green/Red/Yellow sensor* so please check with the seller which one you have (type 2 is the most common).

| Sensor type 1 | Sensor type 2 | Sensor type 3 | Espruino   | 4.7k Resistor |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Black     | Green     | Yellow | GND        |               |
| Red       | Red       | Red | 3.3v       | 1st wire      |
| White     | Yellow    | Green | Data - any GPIO | 2nd wire      |

To use it (assuming you connected to pin A1), simply write the following on the [right-hand side](/Modules#repl):

```JavaScript
var ow = new OneWire(A1);
var sensor = require("DS18B20").connect(ow);
setInterval(function() {
  console.log(sensor.getTemp());
}, 1000);
```

And the current temperature will be displayed every second. Note that the first time getTemp is called, an incorrect temperature may be returned.

```JavaScript
=27.625
```

Multiple sensors
---------------

The DS18B20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus, which allows connecting multiple thermometers on the same data line.

To create an array containing three sensors, simply:

```JavaScript
var ow = new OneWire(A1);
var sensor1 = require("DS18B20").connect(ow, 0);
var sensor2 = require("DS18B20").connect(ow, 1);
var sensor3 = require("DS18B20").connect(ow, 2);
var sensors = [sensor1, sensor2, sensor3];
```

Alternatively, you can create the same array with a little help of the Array.map() function:

```JavaScript
var sensors = ow.search().map(function (device) {
  return require("DS18B20").connect(ow, device);
});
```

Now make a function that will be called repeatedly by Espruino:

```JavaScript
setInterval(function() {
  sensors.forEach(function (sensor, index) {
    console.log(index + ": " + sensor.getTemp());
  });
}, 1000);
```

And the current temperature of each sensor will be displayed every second:

```JavaScript
0: 25.3125
1: 21.0625
2: 24.1875
```

Module reference
---------------

**Function setRes(res)** - Sets the temperature conversion resolution. DS18B20 supports four resolutions: 9-bit, 10-bit, 11-bit and 12-bit. This setting is stored in device's EEPROM so it persists even after the sensor loses power.

Parameters:

* **res** - {Number} Conversion resolution, must have one of these values: 9, 10, 11 or 12. If value is out of this range then it gets constrained.

**Function getRes()** - Gets the current temperature conversion resolution.

Returns:

* Number: 9, 10, 11 or 12.

**Function getTemp(verify)** - Gets the temperature reading.

Parameters:

* **verify** - {Boolean} Optional parameter. If set to ```true``` then the 1-Wire bus is scanned first to make sure that the sensor is still connected. If it is not found then ```null``` is returned.
If this parameter is not set (or set to ```false```) and the sensor is not found then you will get incorrect temperature reading.
Setting this parameter to ```true``` will make the temperature reading take a bit longer.

Returns:

* Number or null: The temperature in degrees Celsius. If "verify" parameter was set to ```true``` and sensor was not found then returned value is set to ```null```.

**Function isPresent()** - Checks if the sensor is still correctly connected on the 1-Wire bus.

Returns:

* Boolean: ```true``` if sensor's serial code is found on the bus or ```false``` otherwise.

**Function searchAlarm()** - Return a list of sensors on the bus with their alarms set

**Function setAlarm(lo, hi)** - Set low and high alarm values for the DS18B20 in whole degrees C. If the temperature goes below `lo` or above `hi` the alarm will be set.
