In the KickStarter video we used an Espruino-controlled Robot, this is available from Olimex (see links below).

Additional Components
------------------

The kit contains the chassis, motors and wheels, but you still need something to control the motors.

We used:

* An [Espruino Board](EspruinoBoard) 
* A [[L293D]] Motor Driver IC soldered on to the board
* A [[HC-SR04]] Ultrasonic Distance Sensor so that the Robot could sense the distance to obstacles.
