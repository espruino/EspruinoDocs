The [RGB123](http://rgb-123.com/) LED matrices are boards full of individually addressable RGB LEDs. This means that you can get a full-colour image by wiring up just 3 wires.

We'd suggest you wire up as follows. The only condition is that the data wire is connected to an SPI MOSI port on the Espruino Board:

| RGB-123 | Espruino  |
| ------- | ---------- |
| GND	  | GND        |
| DIN     | B15        | 
| 5V      | VBAT       |

When running full-power, the RGB123 panels draw a lot of power. You may find you need to wire the 5V line up to a separate power supply.

**DO NOT WIRE UP THE VOLTAGE BACKWARDS** - WS2812 chips are quite delicate and the entire board can be easily blown up by doing this.

You can then use Espruino's built-in [graphics library](/Reference#Graphics):

For an 8x8 display, use the following:

```
var neopixel = require("neopixel");
var leds = Graphics.createArrayBuffer(8,8,24,{zigzag:true}); 
leds.flip = function() { neopixel.write(B15, leds.buffer); };
// now you can draw..
leds.clear();
// a box
leds.setColor(0.1,0,0);
leds.moveTo(0,0);
leds.lineTo(7,0);
leds.lineTo(7,7);
leds.lineTo(0,7);
leds.lineTo(0,0);
// some text
leds.setColor(0.1,0.1,0.1);
leds.drawString(":)",0,1);
leds.flip();
```

For other sizes, change the first two arguments of ```createArrayBuffer``` to the width and height of your display.

For more details on interfacing (or for interfacing to RGB123 strips), see [[WS2811]] (the driver chip).
