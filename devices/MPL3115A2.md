MPL3115A2 Digital Altitude / Pressure / Temperature Sensor
============================================

* KEYWORDS: Module,I2C,MPL3115,Alt,Temp,barometer,kPa,celsius

Wiring Up
--------

All modules listed below appear to have I2C pullup resistors, so you need to connect `VCC`, `GND`, and `SDA` and `SCL` (`INT` lines are not required).

As an example, for the Pico you could use the following. Note that `SDA` and `SCL` should be connected to two pins capable of using the same [[I2C]] device (see your board's documentation page).

| Pin | Espruino |
|-----|----------|
| GND | GND      |
| VCC | 3.3v (see note below) |
| SDA | B4       |
| SCL | A8       |

**Note:** the Adafruit module has a voltage regulator, so you should connect `Vin` to `5V` on the Espruino, and should leave 3.3v unconnected.

Software
-------

Because measurements can take a while, the module uses callbacks when data is available.

For instance to get the altitude:

```
I2C3.setup({sda:B4,scl:A8});
var mpl = require("MPL3115A2").connect(I2C3);
mpl.getAltitude(function(x) {
  console.log("Altitude "+x+" m");
});
```

You can't set measurements going concurrently, so if you want to measure all 3, you'll need to nest your callbacks:

```
I2C3.setup({sda:B4,scl:A8});
var mpl = require("MPL3115A2").connect(I2C3);
mpl.getPressure(function(x) {
  console.log("Pressure "+x+" pa");
  mpl.getAltitude(function(x) {
    console.log("Altitude "+x+" m");
      mpl.getTemperature(function(x) {
      console.log("Temperature "+x+" C");
    });
  });
});
```
