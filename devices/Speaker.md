Espruino can either output square waves using [[PWM]], or low sample rate can be output using the [[Waveform]] class.

To use a speaker with Espruino you'll have to connect it to pins marked with [[PWM]] or [[DAC]].

Useful sources of speakers are:

* Inside old Personal Computers. They usually also come with a wire and a [[Pin Strip]] connector attached, and look like the larger speaker in the picture above.
* Musical Christmas cards have a small piezoelectric speaker inside them that looks like the small gold disc above. This won't be very loud.
* Old headphones can also be a good source

Please bear in mind that Espruino can supply only 20mA at 3.3v on its outputs, so you shouldn't attach a huge speaker to it!
