* KEYWORDS: Mounting,Screws,Screw,Mount
* USES: Espruino Board

The Espruino board doesn't have any mounting holes on it (there just isn't space!), but you do have a few options for mounting it.

* Use a 3D Printed Box or Mount (see our [EspruinoBoard](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoBoard/tree/master/boxes) repository)
* Use PCB mounts designed edge mounting - for example [these ones](https://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/11/21/new-product-board-edge-mounting-kit-pack-of-4-raspberry_pi/)
* Solder Espruino to a bit of proto board, and drill holes in that
* Tape Espruino down with double-sided tape ('Servo Tape' is designed for this kind of thing)
* Use Cable ties
* Drill though some of the holes in Espruino's Prototyping area (check that no wires go past them on the PCB)
* Solder a mount onto some of the pins that you're not using - for example you could solder on [a ring crimp connector](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/crimp-ring-terminals/6881439/) and could then screw through it.
